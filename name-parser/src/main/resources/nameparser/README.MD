# latin-endings.txt
The suffices were generated querying the genus names in checklistbank. All endings with 4 chars that existed in at least 100 different genus names were added.
The query used was:

   select substring(genus from '....$') as suffix from (select distinct genus_or_above as genus from name) as genera group by suffix having count(*) > 100;

To sort the suffices by their ending linux provides a nice tool:

   $ cat latin-endings.txt | rev | sort | rev > latin-endings.txt2




# Epithet Blacklist
The list of blacklisted epithets is used by the parser to flag doubtful names.
A little python script blacklist-test.py can be used to query the current GBIF ChecklistBank API for each epithet and report number of matches.

## Notes on some blacklisted epithets that still yield matches in GBIF

 - `die` `Anticharis die Isiana Pilg.` is a bad name based on `Anticharis dielsiana Pilg.`
 - `mon` `Euchroeus mon` is a bad name based on [Euchroeus mongolicus in Pensoft](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/4271/list/13/)
